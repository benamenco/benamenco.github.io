Short intro of metabolomics
1. to develop ;
2. to provide new evidence to better understand the   .

### Topics

* Targeted and non-targeted metabolomics of foods and nutrition.

* other.

### Research Notes

* Comming soon...

## Bioinformatics
-----

As an important part of my research, I have developed several computing software to do the actual computational tasks. Currently, I have released three open source software: [Polyorder]({{ site.url }}/software/), [Gyroid]({{ site.url }}/software/), [NGPy]({{ site.url }}/software/).

### Implemented Algorithms

* R for metabolomics
* R for microbiome
